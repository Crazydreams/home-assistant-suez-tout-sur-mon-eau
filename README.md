# SUEZ - Tout sur mon eau Addon for Home Assistant

Get daily water consumption from [Tout sur mon eau](https://www.toutsurmoneau.fr/) to Home Assistant as a state. The update occurs every day at 4am.

### Synopsis

This project has been inspired by [PySuez](https://github.com/ooii/pySuez) and [Suez Water integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/suez_water/).

### Motivation

The Tout sur mon eau website keeps changing structures and algorithms, which break unofficial libraries to get the data. I reached out to know if there's any plan for an official API, unfortunately they never replied.

## Installation

 - Add the add-ons repository to your Home Assistant: `https://github.com/sannremy/home-assistant-suez-tout-sur-mon-eau`.
 - Install the *SUEZ - Tout sur mon eau* add-on.
 - Configure the add-on with your SUEZ credentials and meter ID.
